The following it the API reference for the [fastapi_poe](https://github.com/poe-platform/fastapi_poe) client library. The reference assumes that you used `import fastapi_poe as fp`.

## `fp.PoeBot`

The class that you use to define your bot behavior. Once you define your PoeBot class, you
pass it to `make_app` to create a FastAPI app that serves your bot.

#### Parameters:
- `path` (`str = "/"`): This is the path at which your bot is served. By default, it's
set to "/" but this is something you can adjust. This is especially useful if you want to serve
multiple bots from one server.
- `access_key` (`Optional[str] = None`): This is the access key for your bot and when
provided is used to validate that the requests are coming from a trusted source. This access key
should be the same one that you provide when integrating your bot with Poe at:
https://poe.com/create_bot?server=1. You can also set this to None but certain features like
file output that mandate an `access_key` will not be available for your bot.
- `concat_attachments_to_message` (`bool = True`): A flag to decide whether to parse out
content from attachments and concatenate it to the conversation message. This is set to `True`
by default and we recommend leaving on since it allows your bot to comprehend attachments
uploaded by users by default.

### `PoeBot.get_response`

Override this to define your bot's response given a user query.
#### Parameters:
- `request` (`QueryRequest`): an object representing the chat response request from Poe.
This will contain information about the chat state among other things.

#### Returns:
- `AsyncIterable[PartialResponse]`: objects representing your
response to the Poe servers. This is what gets displayed to the user.

Example usage:
```python
async def get_response(self, request: fp.QueryRequest) -> AsyncIterable[fp.PartialResponse]:
    last_message = request.query[-1].content
    yield fp.PartialResponse(text=last_message)
```

### `PoeBot.get_response_with_context`

A version of `get_response` that also includes the request context information. By
default, this will call `get_response`.
#### Parameters:
- `request` (`QueryRequest`): an object representing the chat response request from Poe.
This will contain information about the chat state among other things.
- `context` (`RequestContext`): an object representing the current HTTP request.

#### Returns:
- `AsyncIterable[Union[PartialResponse, ErrorResponse]]`: objects representing your
response to the Poe servers. This is what gets displayed to the user.

### `PoeBot.get_settings`

Override this to define your bot's settings.

#### Parameters:
- `setting` (`SettingsRequest`): An object representing the settings request.

#### Returns:
- `SettingsResponse`: An object representing the settings you want to use for your bot.

### `PoeBot.get_settings_with_context`

A version of `get_settings` that also includes the request context information. By
default, this will call `get_settings`.

#### Parameters:
- `setting` (`SettingsRequest`): An object representing the settings request.
- `context` (`RequestContext`): an object representing the current HTTP request.

#### Returns:
- `SettingsResponse`: An object representing the settings you want to use for your bot.

### `PoeBot.on_feedback`

Override this to record feedback from the user.
#### Parameters:
- `feedback_request` (`ReportFeedbackRequest`): An object representing the Feedback rqeuest
from Poe. This is sent out when a user provides feedback on a response on your bot.
#### Returns: `None`

### `PoeBot.on_feedback_with_context`

A version of `on_feedback` that also includes the request context information. By
default, this will call `on_feedback`.

#### Parameters:
- `feedback_request` (`ReportFeedbackRequest`): An object representing a feedback rqeuest
from Poe. This is sent out when a user provides feedback on a response on your bot.
- `context` (`RequestContext`): an object representing the current HTTP request.
#### Returns: `None`

### `PoeBot.on_error`

Override this to record errors from the Poe server.
#### Parameters:
- `error_request` (`ReportErrorRequest`): An object representing an error request from Poe.
This is sent out when the Poe server runs into an issue processing the response from your
bot.
#### Returns: `None`

### `PoeBot.on_error_with_context`

A version of `on_error` that also includes the request context information. By
default, this will call `on_error`.

#### Parameters:
- `error_request` (`ReportErrorRequest`): An object representing an error request from Poe.
This is sent out when the Poe server runs into an issue processing the response from your
bot.
- `context` (`RequestContext`): an object representing the current HTTP request.
#### Returns: `None`

### `PoeBot.post_message_attachment`

Used to output an attachment in your bot's response.

#### Parameters:
- `message_id` (`Identifier`): The message id associated with the current QueryRequest
object. **Important**: This must be the request that is currently being handled by
get_response. Attempting to attach files to previously handled requests will fail.
- `access_key` (`str`): The access_key corresponding to your bot. This is needed to ensure
that file upload requests are coming from an authorized source.
- `download_url` (`Optional[str] = None`): A url to the file to be attached to the message.
- `file_data` (`Optional[Union[bytes, BinaryIO]] = None`): The contents of the file to be
uploaded. This should be a bytes-like or file object.
- `filename` (`Optional[str] = None`): The name of the file to be attached.
#### Returns:
- `AttachmentUploadResponse`

**Note**: You need to provide either the `download_url` or both of `file_data` and
`filename`.

### `PoeBot.concat_attachment_content_to_message_body`

Concatenate received attachment file content into the message body. This will be called
by default if `concat_attachments_to_message` is set to `True` but can also be used
manually if needed.

#### Parameters:
- `query_request` (`QueryRequest`): the request object from Poe.
#### Returns:
- `QueryRequest`: the request object after the attachments are unpacked and added to the
message body.

## `fp.make_app`

Create an app object for your bot(s).

#### Parameters:
- `bot` (`Union[PoeBot, Sequence[PoeBot]]`): A bot object or a list of bot objects if you want
to host multiple bots on one server.
- `access_key` (`str = ""`): The access key to use.  If not provided, the server tries to
read the POE_ACCESS_KEY environment variable. If that is not set, the server will
refuse to start, unless `allow_without_key` is True. If multiple bots are provided,
the access key must be provided as part of the bot object.
- `allow_without_key` (`bool = False`): If True, the server will start even if no access
key is provided. Requests will not be checked against any key. If an access key is provided, it
is still checked.
- `app` (`Optional[FastAPI] = None`): A FastAPI app instance. If provided, the app will be
configured with the provided bots, access keys, and other settings. If not provided, a new
FastAPI application instance will be created and configured.
#### Returns:
- `FastAPI`: A FastAPI app configured to serve your bot when run.

---

## `fp.MetaResponse`

Similar to `Partial Response`. Yield this to communicate `meta` events from server bots.

#### Fields:

bot.
- `introduction_message` (`str = ""`): The introduction message to display to the users of your
bot.
- `expand_text_attachments` (`bool = True`): Whether to request parsed content/descriptions from
text attachments with the query request. This content is sent through the new parsed_content

images.
